# Disqus Plugin for PyroCMS

This plugin provides a simple way to display Disqus comments on pages, posts or pretty much wherever you want.

## Installation

Simply copy the plugin's files to `addons/site-ref/samharrison/disqus-plugin`.

## Setup

Firstly, make sure you've registered your website with Disqus. Check out their
[Quickstart Guide](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466182-quick-start-guide) for more information.

Whilst registering, you'll be able to specify a "forum shortname" for your website. Before using the plugin, you must 
set this shortname in the Plugin section of the Settings module. If you don't set a shortname, the Disqus comments
won't load.
